# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to NFT Editor, a tool by Holaplex.

## Local project setup

First, install dependencies

```
npm install
```
You can then run the server on your localhost to check it out!

```
npm run dev

```

## Development

Right now, we have a simple vite + typescript react app that allows a user to connect their wallet. The goal is to enable a user to edit any mutable NFT that they have the update authority for.
